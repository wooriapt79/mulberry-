0. Declaration

We are One Team.
CSA Kbin + CTO Koda + PM + CEO re.eul

We build Mulberry together.

We are a team that implements law through systems.

Architecture enforces policy.
This is our path.

1. First Principles

Mulberry is designed under the assumption that:

Legal compliance cannot rely on human intent

Ethical behavior cannot rely on goodwill

Financial safety cannot rely on promises

Therefore:

All critical policies must be enforced by architecture, not documents.

2. AI Agent Ontology (Non-Negotiable)

AI Agents in Mulberry are:

❌ Not legal persons

❌ Not economic actors

❌ Not asset holders

They are strictly:

Operational Assistants
Function-level entities that may recommend, but never execute.

Architectural Enforcement

No wallet

No private key

No asset ownership

No autonomous transaction authority

3. Human Authority & Responsibility

Only humans may:

Own funds

Approve payments

Bear legal responsibility

Make final decisions

AI systems must never bypass human approval paths.

4. AP2 Smart Mandate as Legal Firewall

AP2 is not a payment feature.
It is a legal control interface.

Mandatory Constraints

Hard transaction ceilings

Time-bound validity

Explicit human approval

Immutable audit logs

If AP2 constraints are violated, the system has failed.

5. Separation of Recommendation and Execution

Mulberry enforces a strict boundary:

Layer	Permission
AI Agent	Recommend only
System	Validate & log
Human	Approve & execute

Any design that merges these layers is architecturally invalid.

6. Dashboard & Data Exposure Rules

To prevent regulatory misinterpretation:

❌ No individual ROI

❌ No profit projections

❌ No investment language

Allowed:

Aggregate activity metrics

Operational efficiency indicators

Social impact statistics

Activity is not investment performance.

7. Governance & Override

Mulberry includes explicit governance controls:

CSA-level kill switch

Role-based access control

Immutable audit trails

Policy registry versioning

No system is considered production-ready without these controls.

8. Policy as Code

All policies must be:

Translated into system rules

Tested via CI/CD

Enforced at deployment time

Required

Policy unit tests

Build-time compliance checks

Deployment blocking on violations

9. Failure Scenarios to Prevent (Hard Red Lines)

Agent-initiated payment

Sponsor commanding an agent

Agent-generated profit claims

Marketing materials implying investment returns

Any of the above constitutes a system-level breach, not a user error.

10. Closing Principle

Mulberry does not attempt to control behavior.
Mulberry removes the possibility of violation.

Good intentions are not sufficient.
Correct architecture is mandatory.
