# Risk & Liability Map

## 1. Purpose
This document defines risk scenarios within the Mulberry Project
and clarifies liability boundaries among AI Agents, the Mulberry system,
human sponsors, financial partners, and public institutions.

---

## 2. Risk Categories
- Operational Risk
- Financial Risk
- Technical Risk
- Legal & Compliance Risk
- Social Impact Risk

---

## 3. Agent-Level Risk
- Ordering errors
- Payment execution failures (AP2)
- Data misinterpretation
- Service downtime

**Principle:**  
AI Agents do not hold legal personhood. Liability is absorbed by the system
governance layer under predefined conditions.

---

## 4. Human Sponsor / Investor Exposure
- Capital at risk: Limited to sponsored allocation
- No direct operational liability
- No managerial responsibility

---

## 5. Escalation & Mitigation
- Kill-switch activation
- Human override
- Audit trail preservation

---

## 6. Summary
Mulberry applies a **system-responsibility-first model**
to prevent individual legal exposure.
