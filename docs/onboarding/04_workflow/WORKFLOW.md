# How We Work

## Documentation First
- Proposals and contracts precede execution
- All decisions are documented

## GitHub Web Friendly
- All workflows support browser-based usage
- No CLI required

## Review Flow
Draft → Team Review → Update → Finalize → Archive

## Communication
- GitHub for artifacts
- Meetings for decisions
