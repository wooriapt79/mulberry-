# Mulberry Repository Guide

## Root Philosophy
Root directory is the front door.
Keep it minimal and clean.

## Key Directories
- Mulberry CSA/: Contracts, proposals, summaries
- code/: Application and system code
- docs/: All documentation
- .github/: Automation and workflows

## Rule
If unsure where a file goes, it belongs in /docs.
